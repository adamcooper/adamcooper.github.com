<h2>About Me</h2>

What about me are looking for?
<ul>
<li>Development Ideas and Thoughts</li>
<li>Hobbies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>Agile and Web please.  After trying a couple different areas of
development I've found one that resonates.  In the past, I've done
Embedded Phone Development, Enterprise Java and .NET integration,
and Technical Sales.  I've spent the past 5 years with web development
and found the technology area for me.</p>

<p>I identify most as a Ruby (on Rails) developer, but I've performed
other roles, Technical Lead, Team Mentor, Scrum Master.  Agile and
Craftmanship are not buzzwords to me but everyday realities.</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>

<p>As cliche as it may be, programming is a hobby of mine.  I stay up to
date with latest trends and thoughts but still maintain my own.</p>
<p>I completed an <strong>Ironman</strong> a couple years ago and
immensely enjoyed myself.  All three activities, running, biking, and
swimming, hold a special place in my heart.  Recently I've started up
barefoot running.</p>
<p>Ultimate has recently grabbed my attention and it has reminded of fun
team sports such as soccer, which I grew up playing.</p>
